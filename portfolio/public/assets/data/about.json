	"bio1": "I am a 2nd Bachelor's student attending Chapman University to learn more about my passion, Software Engineering. Before attending Chapman, I graduated from the University of San Diego where I got a Bachelorâ€™s in Business Administration (as a pre-med student). By graduation, I knew medicine did not excite me enough to want to pursue a career in the field. I always had an interest in technology and software, so I attended the UCI Coding Bootcamp very soon after graduating from USD.",
	"bio2": "The Bootcamp solidified my realization that computer programming is my passion and the career path I want to continue to pursue. I deiced to go back to a 4-year university, Chapman University, for a 2nd Bachelor's in Software Engineering to take the opportunity to learn more about my newly discovered passion. In addition to attending Chapman, I have interned as a software engineer with multiple companies such as Forkaia, Pacific Life Insurnace, and now currently HumanID. Please feel welcome to message me on LinkedIn or send me an email if you have any questions.",
